  The result of standardization (or Z-score normalization) is that the features will be
  rescaled so that they’ll have the properties of a standard normal distribution with

  μ=0 and σ=1

  where μ is the mean (average) and σ is the standard deviation from the mean;
  standard scores (also called z scores) of the samples are calculated as follows:

  z = x − μσ
